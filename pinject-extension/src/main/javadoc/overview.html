    CDI Extension Module
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Pinject</em> is a CDI extension that injects property values into 
    CDI-managed beans. By simply adding a {@code @Property} qualifier to your 
    injection points and putting the corresponding property value in a 
    properties file or system property that can be located by the extension, 
    you can inject properties for strings, numbers, URLs, etc.  
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Pinject</em> is extensible using the JDK's {@code ServiceLoader} 
    mechanism. By providing your own property converters, the extension can 
    inject property values of almost any type that has a well-defined string 
    representation.  Moreover, by providing your own custom resolver, you 
    can resolve property values in practically any manner that suits the 
    needs of your application.
